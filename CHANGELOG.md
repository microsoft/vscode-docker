## 1.24.0 - 22 February 2023
### Added
* Support has been added for deploying a container image from an image registry (Azure Container Registry, Docker Hub, etc.) to Azure Container Apps. This feature also requires the [Azure Container Apps extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurecontainerapps). [#3535](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3535)
* Some more advanced diagnostic logging is available in the Output window, by using the command "Developer: Set Log Level...", choosing Docker, and changing the log level to "Debug" or "Trace". [#3809](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3809)

### Fixed

* By default, Python apps will now be scaffolded with Python 3.10 base images (up from Python 3.8). [#3736](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3736)

## 1.23.3 - 14 December 2022
### Fixed
* Old versions of Docker Engine should no longer show "Invalid JSON" errors in the container view. [#3724](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3724)
* Container file ownership and permissions were being overwritten when the file was saved. [#3740](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3740)
* If the `docker-run` task emitted a warning or error, debugging would not start, instead just spinning forever. [#3751](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3751)
* If an image name contained a registry that was just a hostname and port, parsing would fail. [#3752](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3752)

## 1.23.2 - 7 December 2022
### Fixed
* If an older version of Docker Engine / Docker CE was present, the containers view would not work. [#3724](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3724)
* Image tag format was excessively verbose for common images. [#3734](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3734)
* On Windows, if PowerShell profiles were in use, many features would not work. [#3725](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3725)

### Fixed
* Images were sometimes listed as created "NaN years ago". [#3718](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3718)
* Certain image name formats caused the containers view to no longer work. [#3719](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3719)
* The `customOptions` and `command` properties on certain tasks were being over-escaped. [#3722](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3722)
* `docker-compose` tasks with a list of services to start were being over-escaped. [#3726](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3726)

## 1.23.0 - 28 November 2022
### Added
* This version includes major changes and rearchitecting to use the Docker CLI exclusively, instead of a mix of the CLI and the HTTP API. This fixes a very common class of issues where the CLI would be working, but the Explorer view would not. [#3263](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3263)
* Added a new `docker.environment` setting that replaces `docker.host`, `docker.context`, `docker.machineName`, etc. If these settings are in use, you will be prompted to automatically migrate them on first use. [#3539](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3539)

### Fixed
* No communication with Docker should occur until the Explorer view is opened or a command is run. [#3475](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3475)
* The explorer view did not work if certificates were needed to authenticate to the Docker server, or if a `gpg-agent` was in use, or several other scenarios. [#2058](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2058), [#3295](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3295), [#3590](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3590)
* Debugging Python apps in WSL, without Docker Desktop, should now work. [#3525](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3525)

### Removed
* The `docker.explorerRefreshInterval` setting has been removed. Instead of the Explorer view refreshing automatically every two seconds (by default), refreshes occur when relevant events are detected. [#3674](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3674)
* As part of the move to using the CLI, the `--mount` flag is now used instead of `--volume` when adding volumes to containers. As a result, the SELinux relabel option `,z` is no longer supported. [#3656](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3656)
* Features related to Azure Container Instances (ACI), including creating and using ACI contexts, and deploying to ACI, have been removed. [#3655](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3655)

## 1.22.2 - 18 October 2022

### Fixed
* Fixed a crash that could occur with certain Dockerfiles. [#3450](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3450)

## 1.22.0 - 18 April 2022
### Added
* Added a setting, `docker.composeCommand`, to allow configuring the command used for Compose operations. If unset, the extension will attempt to automatically detect whether to use `docker compose` or `docker-compose`. [#2977](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2977)
* In Python projects, the `.venv` directory is now added to the `.dockerignore` file, so it will no longer be part of the `docker build` context. [#3476](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3476)
* A "Copy Full Tag" command has been added for images in the Registries view. [#3481](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3481)

## 1.21.0 - 21 March 2022
### Added
* Added the `projectName` option to `docker-compose` tasks, corresponding to `--project-name`. [#3436](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3436)
* Support for the `options.env` and `options.cwd` options on all task types. [#3437](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3437)
* Support for the `${userHome}` task variable on all task types. [#3455](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3455)

### Fixed
* Flask apps will now use port 5002 by default, and .NET apps will use the semi-random port scaffolded in the `launchSettings.json` file. This will avoid conflicting with port 5000 which is often in-use on Mac. [#3381](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3381)
* Fixed an issue in the container files explorer on Windows containers with other localizations. [#3415](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3415)
* The experience for adding Dockerfiles to Django projects has been improved slightly. [#3410](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3410)

## 1.19.0 - 17 January 2022
### Added
* For volume mappings in `docker-run` tasks, the `ro,z` and `rw,z` permissions have been added, allowing support for SELinux systems. [#3289](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3289)

### Fixed
* `docker-run` and `docker-build` tasks will now respect the `docker.dockerPath` setting. [#3281](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3281)

[#78](https://github.com/microsoft/compose-language-service/issues/78), [#70](https://github.com/microsoft/compose-language-service/issues/70), [#69](https://github.com/microsoft/compose-language-service/issues/69), [#68](https://github.com/microsoft/compose-language-service/issues/68), [#65](https://github.com/microsoft/compose-language-service/issues/65)
* For .NET projects, the `/p:UseAppHost=false` argument is added to the `dotnet publish` command line, in order to prevent a duplicate executable file being created and bloating image size. [#3371](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3371)
* The `envFiles` option in `docker-compose` tasks has been replaced with `envFile`, as only one is actually allowed. [#3339](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3339)

## 1.18.0 - 15 November 2021
### Added
* Substantial additions (to completions especially) have been made to the Compose language service. It now has near-parity to the previously-available features. [#3222](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3222)
* The Compose language service has been turned on by default. [#3288](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3288)
* The walkthrough with the [VSCode walkthrough experience](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_57#_new-getting-started-experience) is no longer an experiment and is visible to all users. The previous "Getting Started" page has been removed. [#3055](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3055), [#3248](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3248)
* A command to show `docker stats` in the terminal has been added. [#3063](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3063)

### Fixed

* Azure Arc custom locations should now show up again in the location selection list. [#3213](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3213)
* A fix has been made to an infinite loop error in the Dockerfile language service. [#3268](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3268)

## 1.17.0 - 20 September 2021
### Added
* Docker Context lookup at the time of extension activation will now always try using the gRPC API first, due to superior performance. Previously this was an experiment. [#3157](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/3157)

### Fixed
* "Invalid JSON response body" on certain registry connections. [#3185](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3185)
* Explorer view would appear to load forever if Docker was not installed. [#3132](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3132)

### Removed
* The "Report Issue" button has been removed from error toasts. Instead, you can use the command "Docker: Report Issue". [#3127](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3127)
* Since it is now end-of-life, code specific to .NET Core 2.1 has been removed. [#3093](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3093)

### Experiments (may not be visible to all users)
* A walkthrough has been added using the new [VSCode walkthrough experience](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_57#_new-getting-started-experience), replacing the Docker start page. [#3055](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/3055)

## 1.16.1 - 1 September 2021
### Fixed

* Generic registry auth will now try both `POST` and `GET` to obtain a token. [#2735](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2735)
* Commands launched on compose groups from the containers panel now use the compose project name. [#2755](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2755)
* Containers will now more reliably be removed after debugging when using the Restart option. [#2676](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2676)

## 1.11.0 - 15 March 2021
### Added
* Scaffolding and debugging for Python FastAPI is now added. Thanks @Kludex! [#2615](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2615)

### Fixed
* The use of keytar has been removed since VS Code now has a secret storage API. Users will need to log in to their registries again. [#2699](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2699)
* In the files explorer, folders containing spaces should work. [#2739](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2739)
* Adding Dockerfiles to a (ASP).NET app will now automatically generate the required .NET build task, using the C# extension. [#2669](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2669)
* Python `docker-run` tasks should now respect the `dockerRun` `command` option in tasks.json. [#2725](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2725)
* Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) images were sometimes incorrectly being flagged as out-of-date. [#2730](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2730)

## 1.10.0 - 15 February 2021
### Added
* Added tooltips to the various explorer views, which will show a great deal of helpful information. For example, the containers tooltips show connected volumes, networks, ports, and more. [#1002](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/1002), [#2538](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2538), [#2592](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2592)
* Editing files in a running Linux container is now possible. [#2465](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2465)

* In `docker-build` and `docker-run` tasks, the `docker.host` setting is now honored. [#2590](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2590)
* The preferred file name for Docker Compose files is now "compose.yaml". Scaffolding will still use "docker-compose.yml" for now, but "compose.yaml" files will be recognized as Compose files, allowing for right click -> Compose Up, etc. [#2618](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2618)
* Codicons are now used for almost all icons. [#2654](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/2654)

### Fixed
* The previously available feature for checking if images are out of date has been re-enabled by default. The behavior now uses HEAD requests which are not subject to Docker Hub's rate limiting. This feature can be disabled with the setting `docker.images.checkForOutdatedImages`. [#2691](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/2691)
* GitLab registry connection now supports--and requires--using personal access tokens. Users previously connecting with username and password will need to reconnect with a personal access token.

## 0.2.0 - 5 September 2018

### Added
* Add preview support for connecting to private registries

  - When default registry path is prefixed to the image name, it is selected for easy removal or editing
* Improved workflow for Build Image:
  - Previous image name will be remembered
* Azure container registries can now be browsed without having "Admin user" turned on. However, deploying to Azure app service currently still requires it, and you still need to log in to Azure in docker [#359](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/359)
* A new [API](docs\api.md) has been added for other extensions to be able to control the "Add Docker Files to Workspace" functionality.

  - Folding support for comments
  - Fix for [#338 Multi-line LABEL directives highlight as errors](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/issues/338)
  - Support for handling SCTP ports in EXPOSE instructions per Docker CE 18.03
  - Optional warning/error for WORKDIR instructions that are not absolute paths (to try to enforce good practices per the official guidelines and recommendations document for Dockerfiles
  - New `docker.languageserver.diagnostics.instructionWorkdirRelative` configuration setting
* Output title corrected [#428](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docker/pull/428)

### Changed
* The `docker.defaultRegistry` setting is now obsolete. Instead of using a combination of `docker.defaultRegistry` and `docker.defaultRegistryPath`, now simply use `docker.defaultRegistryPath`. This will be suggested automatically the first time the extension is run.

  * `start Azure CLI` container
  * `stop container`
  * `system prune`
